# sf_score

Implements a metric for comparing the quality k-means clustering algorithms and select an optimal number of clusters. From [this paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Bounded-Index-for-Cluster-Validity-Saitta-Raphael/2fb5b1707e5ebec72ff8a0c8e75dd0fd00256d8d?p2df). I wrote this as part of an assignment for Machine Learning with Neural Signal with professor Michael Spezio in fall 2023.
